Recommendation System for area of work/study based on personal interests
In this report, we describe an educational data mining analysis to recommend an area of study/work based on personal interests of graduate students. We created a survey for the MMSc graduate students of University of Waterloo to better understand the behaviors and attitudes associated with the area of study/work. On the collected data, we implemented classification algorithms like Naive Bayes, Decision tree, KNN and Random Forests. We also implemented Clustering algorithms and Association Rule Mining. 
Prior to model implementation, we assumed that technical questions in the survey will be more important in prediction, but from feature selection we observed that even the non-technical questions were impactful. Another interesting observation was that some students categorized in Data science and Supply Chain Management have similar interests, whereas students classified in Organizational Behavior have different set of interests.
